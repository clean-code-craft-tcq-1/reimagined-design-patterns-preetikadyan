# reimagined-design-patterns

Give a summary description of Four design patterns that you choose from the following design patterns: **Adapter,  Builder, Composite, Decorator, Observer, Interpreter, State, Mediator, Memento, Prototype, Proxy**. In your summaries say:

- what kind of problem(s) you can solve with that pattern and when you use it, maybe with a short example
- how the pattern works, what the basic idea of the pattern is
- what the main advantage and what the the main disadvantage is of using this pattern
- Write a short summary for each of the four patterns, about half a page for each pattern (rather less than more). 

> Do not add diagrams, and do not try to give a complete description of the patterns as found in the books. Rather think of how you would explain the essential ideas of these patterns in a few sentences to a colleague while drinking coffee.

Four Design Patterns

1. Adapter Pattern

  Adapter is structural design pattern to collaborate independent, incompatible/unrelated interfaces. It wraps/ converts the interface of a class/component into a suitable   interface which is expected by a client/other class.

  This pattern is used in cases where you want to integrate a new interface/class/function which is not compatible with the existing functionality and want to reuse several existing subclasses that lack some common functionality that canâ€™t be added to the superclass.

  Advanatages and Disadvantages: You can separate the interface or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the program.You can introduce new types of  interfaces/functionality into the program without breaking the existing code.Re-Usability & Flexibility is provided by this pattern as it provides inheritance.
The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Usgae of this pattern is avoided in case of complex problems. 


2. Prototype Pattern

   Prototyping basically provides a cloning mechanism to clone an object when the inner workings of the class interface of the object cannot be known. This is generally achieved by a cloning method which returns a new cloned object. An example where prototyping is used is when third party libraries are used in the project and the objects need to be cloned but the underlying abstract class implementation is not known. It is akin to cloning a helper robot provided the core robot mechanism is provided by a third party.
   
   Functioning: Prototype design pattern is implemented through extensions of abstract classes (whose inner code may or may not be available to us) and then implementing a cloning function which essentially has the interfaces of the abstract class with some additional implementations. It adheres to the classic definition of a prototype and is similar to class inheritance except for the cloning method.
   
    Advanatages and Disadvantages: An advantage of prototyping is that it eliminates the need for the source code of a third party class implementation. A disadvantage is that circular references are more difficult to identify and debug.

3. Decorator Pattern

   Implementation: Decorator design pattern is mostly used when the core logic of a particular software implementation remains the same while variants perform different pre or postprocessing on the data. A relevant example is our past assignment to generate different notifications for high or low temperatures in the battery management farm. Decorators give the flexibility to add new notification systems easily and the freedom to choose the combination of notifications to the client.
   
    Functioning: Decorator works on the principle of recursive composition. What that means is that it works on the principle of enhancing a class interface through composition rather than inheritance while retaining the interface definition. This follows the Abstraction -> Accumulation flow of design patterns.
    
    PAdvanatages and Disadvantages: Advantage is that it allows different compositions of required behavior at the client while retaining class hierarchy simplicity. Disadvantage is that decorators cannot break the flow of the request since they are recursive.

4. Observer Pattern

   Observer design pattern is used when the change in state of one object needs a functions to be called in another object with minimal overhead. A relevant example is from my workplace wherein, if there is a change in input file content, it should trigger a different build mechanism as opposed to when the input files are unchanged. Observers are useful when you want to add multiple handlers for a state change of an object which only activate when there is a state change.
   
    Functioning: It works on a publisher, subscriber mechanism where the publisher maintains a list of subscribers with an interface to add and remove subscribers. The change of state of the publisher results in a call to notify all subscribers in the subscribers list - this means that each subscriber should have a uniform interface for notification from the publisher.
    
   Advanatages and Disadvantages: An advantage is that it allows addition of subscribers during run-time and isn't static. A disadvantage is that the order in which the subscribers are notified cannot be controlled.
